How to handle immediate event triggers
	maybe better to just trigger it immediately

package.Events

	Event
		Local Data
			- PriorityQueue
			- Time

	NewProcessEvent
		Local Data
			- Process
			- CPUScheduler
			- IOScheduler
		Description
			When a new process is created it is set to the NEW state and a NewProcessEvent is
			created with a time equal to the processes arrival time.
			When triggered, the process is added to the ready queue and a ReadyQueueEvent 
			or a WaitQueueEvent is created with a time equal to current time.

	CPUEvent
		Local Data
			- CPUScheduler
			- IOScheduler
		Description
			When a CPU finshes running its active process, a CPUEvent is triggered.
			When triggered, the CPU sends the process to the correct queue (ready vs waiting)
			depending on if the processes CPUBurst was completed. A ReadyQueueEvent is
			then triggered.

	IOEvent
		Local Data
			- CPUScheduler
			- IOScheduler
		Description
			When an IO finshes running its active process, an IOEvent is triggered.
			When triggered, the IO sends the process to the correct queue (ready vs waiting)
			depending on if the processes IOBurst was completed. A WaitQueueEvent is
			then triggered.

	ReadyQueueEvent
		Local Data
			- CPUScheduler
		Description
			When a CPU is empty and the ReadyQueue is not a ReadyQueueEvent is triggered.
			When triggered, the IO is filled according to its algorithm. A CPUEvent is then
			added to the PriorityQueue.

	WaitQueueEvent
		Local Data
			- IOScheduler
		Description
			When an IO is empty and the WaitQueue is not a WaitQueueEvent is triggered.
			When triggered, the IO is filled according to its algorithm. An IOEvent is then
			added to the PriorityQueue.

	WaitEvent
		Local Data
			- 
		Description

	PauseEvent
		Local Data
			- 
		Description

	ExitEvent
		Local Data
			- 
		Description

	CustomProcess
		Local Data
			- Many Things

	CPU
		Local Data
			- Process

	IO
		Local Data
			- Process

	CPUScheduler
		Local Data
			- Simulation
			- Algorithm
			- CPU
			- ReadyQueue<CustomProcess>
		Description
			Handles which process in the ReadyQueue is ran by the CPU and for how long.

	IOScheduler
		Local Data
			- Simulation
			- Algorithm
			- IO
			- WaitQueue<CustomProcess>
		Description
			Handles which process in the WaitQueue is ran by the IO and for how long.
